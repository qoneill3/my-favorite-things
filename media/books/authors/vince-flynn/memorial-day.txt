Memorial Day
	Another great addition by Vince Flynn to his series revolving around Mitch Rapp. A trained killer, out to do good and kill bad men, just not on the exact terms of the CIA. Flynn's character Rapp is in a constant struggle of fighting terrorist organizations poised to do harm against the USA. In this story an attack on our nations capital sets off a series of events that are absolutely worth the read.
